# GovHack 2019 - Localé

Localé is a tourism based application designed to better connect visitors to local businesses and events in a safe and stress free manner. Localé will also include local area safety and evacuation information to improve community safety. Data generated can be feed back to the council to aid in council and civil defense planning.

## Challenges

**Best use of data to assist in a Civil Emergency** - *GENERATED DATA*

The app can be used to present tourists and locals with emergency information including tsunami evac zones, police stations, safe space (library). Generated data can be exported to civil defence and council for predicting crowd control scenarios and emergency procedures.

**Reducing CBD Traffic Congestion? Foot traffic** - *GENERATED DATA*

In the case of cruise tourists, an offload of people can create both road and foot congestion at crossings and footpaths. We can potentially redirect or evenly distribute tourists to explore different areas around the city, ie walk along Marine Parade before heading into the shopping district. Businesses can also use our data to analyse foot traffic patterns to improve their reach.

**Best Way to Promote Positive Mental Health** - *IMPORTED DATA*

This app encourages both locals and tourists to explore the area and experience exciting new things which should have a positive effect on lowering stress and increasing mental well being. Small businesses sponsor a lot of local sports events, fund raisers, people in hardship etc. It might only be a hundred dollars here or there but its at a local level where as the corporate's have no interest in supporting the small things that does not get there name out there.

**Innovate New Zealand + Best Creative Use of Technology** - *DATA IMPLEMENTATION*

Promoting local business (help them promote themselves)- sponsorship + promoted ads. We are using technology to help local businesses promote themselves to a vast array of new customers from both tourist and local populations that they normally wouldn't be able to reach through other means.
