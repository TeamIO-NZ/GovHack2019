# GovHack 2019 - Localé

![Heroku](https://heroku-badge.herokuapp.com/?app=team-io-locale&style=flat)

Localé is a tourism based application designed to better connect visitors to local businesses and events in a safe and stress free manner. Localé will also include local area safety and evacuation information to improve community safety. Data generated can be feed back to the council to aid in council and civil defense planning.

## Data Story

The problem we found was that visiting tourists and locals need an easy way to get a decent dose of culture and entertainment, while feeling safe and secure in an unfamiliar environment while exploring new areas. We decided to make an app that will help organize events and activities while also providing safety information for civil defense and natural disasters.
Originally we found articles of tourist deaths in New Zealand. Upon learning of these tragedies we decided to find ways to mitigate these deaths while providing a service that will help people have a great experience in New Zealand towns while also supporting local businesses by encouraging people to visit the lesser known ones over big chains.

## Datasets

* [Waterways Map](https://hbrcopendata-hbrc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/34bc4f1a0e184556a7916a9020cc47a9_6) - This map shows river and ocean levels and water safety levels to show tourists where it is safe to swim based on ecoli levels.
* [Walking and Biking trails](https://hbrcopendata-hbrc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/10c773dfc25b4911a457a662d2f17556_0?geometry=173.125%2C-40.165%2C181.486%2C-38.679) - We downloaded this map to help encourage people new to the region to visit our wonderful walking and biking trails to get the best experience of the region.
* [Hawkes Bay Tsunami Evacuation Routes](https://hbrcopendata-hbrc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/4d295d2f775a4972a10ecb1dd09c3774_0/data?geometry=175.881%2C-39.733%2C177.971%2C-39.362) - We downloaded this map so that users that are new to the area have a quick and easy way to access this data in an emergency.
* [Eventfinda RSS](https://www.eventfinda.co.nz/feed/events/hawkes-bay-gisborne/whatson/upcoming.rss) - We scraped this rss feed to build a data set of local events so we could show off the event find feature in our application.
* [International travel and migration data](https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/international-travel-and-migration-september-2018) - We used this data as a research point to look at potential app growth curves over time.

## Challenges

**Best use of data to assist in a Civil Emergency** - *GENERATED DATA*

The app can be used to present tourists and locals with emergency information including tsunami evac zones, police stations, safe space (library). Generated data can be exported to civil defence and council for predicting crowd control scenarios and emergency procedures.

**Reducing CBD Traffic Congestion? Foot traffic** - *GENERATED DATA*

In the case of cruise tourists, an offload of people can create both road and foot congestion at crossings and footpaths. We can potentially redirect or evenly distribute tourists to explore different areas around the city, ie walk along Marine Parade before heading into the shopping district. Businesses can also use our data to analyse foot traffic patterns to improve their reach.

**Best Way to Promote Positive Mental Health** - *IMPORTED DATA*

This app encourages both locals and tourists to explore the area and experience exciting new things which should have a positive effect on lowering stress and increasing mental well being. Small businesses sponsor a lot of local sports events, fund raisers, people in hardship etc. It might only be a hundred dollars here or there but its at a local level where as the corporate's have no interest in supporting the small things that does not get there name out there.

**Innovate New Zealand + Best Creative Use of Technology** - *DATA IMPLEMENTATION*

Promoting local business (help them promote themselves)- sponsorship + promoted ads. We are using technology to help local businesses promote themselves to a vast array of new customers from both tourist and local populations that they normally wouldn't be able to reach through other means.
